# PLAN: Reliable Analysis Pipeline (All Features)

> **Problem**: The system sends raw offer text to Gemini AI in a single-pass with a vague prompt and blindly trusts the response. Salary data is fabricated, red flags may be hallucinated, scores are arbitrary. Downstream features (negotiation, comparison, career) inherit these problems.

---

## Current System Audit

### Core Analysis Pipeline

```mermaid
graph LR
    TEXT["Offer Text"] -->|"single vague prompt"| AI["Gemini AI"]
    AI -->|"raw JSON, no validation"| NORM["Normalize"]
    NORM -->|"save blindly"| DB["DB"]
    
    style AI fill:#ff6b6b,stroke:#333
```

| Problem | Where | Impact |
|---------|-------|--------|
| Single vague prompt, no JSON schema | `buildPrompt()` — just says "output compliant JSON" | Inconsistent structure, AI guesses |
| Salary data hallucinated | `salaryComparison` always `ai_estimated` | Users make career decisions on fabricated numbers |
| Crowdsourced salary DB exists but is never used | `SalaryService.getStats()` is functional, never called by analysis | Real data wasted |
| Score formula is trivial | `70 base ± flags ± percentile` in worker | Doesn't reflect actual offer quality |
| Red flag detection is AI-only | No rules engine | Misses obvious flags, invents others |
| No confidence signals | Every field treated as fact | Users can't tell what's reliable vs guessed |

### Feature-Level Problems

| Feature | Current Approach | Problem |
|---------|-----------------|---------|
| **Salary Comparison** | AI fabricates `p25/p50/p75/p90` from training data | 100% hallucinated. `SalaryService` with crowdsourced data exists but is never connected |
| **Negotiation Script** | Feeds AI-hallucinated `salaryComparison` into negotiation prompt | Garbage-in-garbage-out — negotiation points based on fake market data |
| **Benefits Valuation** | ✅ `benefits.calculator.ts` does real math (PTO × daily rate, etc.) | Decent, but depends on AI-extracted benefit names being correct |
| **Offer Comparison** | Deterministic ranking by score/flags/percentile | Good structure, but all inputs (score, percentile) are AI-fabricated |
| **Career Path** | Calls `ai.generateCareerPath()` with hardcoded `industry: 'Technology'`, `companyType: 'Unknown'` | No real context. Completely generic AI generation |
| **Take-Home Estimate** | AI guesses monthly take-home with "assumptions" | Should be deterministic tax math, not AI speculation |

### Failure Isolation

Each stage produces a result OR a graceful fallback — a single stage failure never blocks the entire pipeline:

| Stage Failure | Fallback | Result |
|---------------|----------|--------|
| Salary lookup fails | AI estimate with `⚠️ AI Estimated` disclaimer | Degraded |
| Rule engine crashes | AI handles all red flag detection | Slightly less reliable |
| Tax calculator fails | Skip take-home section | Core analysis still available |
| Stage 3 AI fails | Return Stage 1 + Stage 2 data without AI narrative | Structured data only |
| Stage 1 extraction fails + retry fails | Fail the job, user can retry with different model | Hard failure |

---

## Stage 1: Structured Extraction (AI → Zod)

**Current**: Single prompt does extraction + analysis + salary comparison + negotiation tips simultaneously.

**Proposed**: Dedicated extraction-only prompt.

- **Sanitize input text** before embedding in prompt — strip control characters, unusual unicode, and prompt-injection patterns
- Use Gemini's **system instruction** (separate from user content) for the extraction schema
- Use Gemini's `responseSchema` parameter to enforce JSON structure at the model level
- Include **2-3 few-shot examples** of annotated extractions for consistency
- Validate output with Zod schema before proceeding
- If validation fails → retry once with validation error feedback
- **Post-extraction sanity checks**: flag suspicious values (CTC > ₹10Cr, CTC < ₹1L for experienced role)
- ~500 tokens per call (fast, cheap)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Key principle**: AI extracts what's IN the text. It does NOT analyze, compare, score, or generate salary data. This eliminates hallucination at the source.

**Extracted fields**:
```
├── companyName, role, department, location, industry, companyType
├── compensation (base, variable, equity, components, totalCTC)
├── benefits (name + verbatim value text)
├── dates (joining, offer expiry)
├── terms (notice period, probation, bond, non-compete)
├── restrictive clauses (verbatim quotes)
└── employmentType, currency
```

**Few-shot example structure** (include 2-3 in prompt):
```
EXAMPLE:
Text: "We are pleased to offer you Senior Software Engineer at Infosys, Bangalore. 
       Your annual CTC will be ₹18,00,000..."
Extraction: {"companyName": "Infosys", "role": "Senior Software Engineer", 
             "location": "Bangalore", "compensation": {"totalCTC": 1800000, "currency": "INR"}, ...}
```

---

## Stage 2: Deterministic Enrichment (No AI, Parallel)

All Stage 2 tasks run via **`Promise.all()`** — they're independent and shouldn't block each other.

### 2a. Salary Benchmarking — Real Data

**Current**: AI fabricates `marketRange: { p25, p50, p75, p90 }`.

**Proposed**: Hybrid real data + disclaimer system.

```mermaid
graph TD
    ROLE["Extracted Role + City"] --> CACHE{"Redis cache hit?"}
    CACHE -->|Yes| CACHED["Return cached stats"]
    CACHE -->|No| DB_CHECK{"≥10 salary submissions?"}
    DB_CHECK -->|Yes| REAL["Use Crowdsourced Data"]
    DB_CHECK -->|No| FUZZY{"Fuzzy match similar roles?"}
    FUZZY -->|Yes| APPROX["Use approximate data + caveat"]
    FUZZY -->|No| AI_EST["AI estimate + ⚠️ disclaimer"]
    
    REAL --> STORE["Cache in Redis (1hr TTL)"]
    APPROX --> STORE
    AI_EST --> STORE
    
    REAL -->|"dataSource: crowdsourced"| OUT["salary comparison"]
    APPROX -->|"dataSource: approximate"| OUT
    AI_EST -->|"dataSource: ai_estimated"| OUT
```

**Implementation details**:
- Wire existing `SalaryService.getStats(role, city)` into analysis worker
- **Fuzzy role matching**: synonym map (`"SDE" ≈ "Software Engineer" ≈ "Software Developer"`)
- **Experience-level filtering**: filter salary submissions by experience bracket, not just role+city
- **Redis caching**: `salary:{role}:{city}` key, 1-hour TTL
- **Minimum sample size**: `n ≥ 10` (raised from 5 for noise resistance)
- Add `dataSource` + `sampleSize` + `dataRecency` fields for UI transparency
- Seed DB with public salary data for bootstrapping

**Data integrity protections**:
- **Statistical outlier detection**: reject submissions >3σ from mean for that role/city
- **Recency weighting**: `weight = 1 / (1 + monthsOld × 0.1)` — older data counts less
- Consider requiring **email verification** for salary submissions

---

### 2b. Red Flag Rule Engine

**Current**: AI decides what's a red flag. May miss obvious ones or hallucinate non-existent ones.

**Proposed**: Pattern-based rules + AI supplement.

| Rule | Pattern | Severity | Type |
|------|---------|----------|------|
| Non-compete | `non-compete`, `restrictive covenant`, `not engage in` | high | `non_compete` |
| Service bond | `bond`, `minimum service`, `lock-in period`, `training cost recovery` | high | `bond` |
| Clawback | `clawback`, `repayment`, `recovery of`, `return of` | high | `clawback` |
| Broad IP assignment | `all intellectual property`, `assign to company`, `work product` | medium | `ip_assignment` |
| Vague compensation | `at discretion`, `may include`, `subject to`, `up to` | medium | `vague_compensation` |
| Probation risk | `terminated without notice during probation` | medium | `probation` |
| At-will clause | `at-will`, `terminate at any time` | low | `other` |
| Missing health insurance | Absence of `health`, `medical`, `insurance` | medium | `missing_benefit` |
| Missing PF/retirement | Absence of `provident fund`, `PF`, `retirement` | low | `missing_benefit` |

- Each rule-flagged issue tagged `source: "rule"` (deterministic)
- AI can still find nuanced issues, tagged `source: "ai"` (with lower confidence)
- UI shows source badge for transparency
- **Prefer `String.includes()` over regex** to avoid ReDoS — use regex only for complex patterns
- **100ms execution timeout** as safety net

---

### 2c. Take-Home Calculator (Indian Tax Regime)

**Current**: AI guesses "monthly take-home: approximately ₹X with assumptions."

**Proposed**: Deterministic calculator for Indian salaries.

| Component | Calculation |
|-----------|-------------|
| Basic salary | From extracted data or 40% of CTC (typical) |
| HRA exemption | min(actual HRA, 50%/40% of basic, rent - 10% of basic) |
| Standard deduction | ₹50,000 |
| EPF employee contribution | 12% of basic (capped at ₹15,000/month) |
| Professional tax | ~₹200/month (state-dependent) |
| Tax (new regime) | Slab-based calculation |
| Tax (old regime) | Slab-based with Section 80C, 80D deductions |

**Output**: Both old and new regime take-home comparisons with breakdown.

---

### 2d. Benefits Calculator (Existing — Enhance)

**Current**: `benefits.calculator.ts` already does PTO valuation, insurance detection, equity categorization. ✅

**Enhancements**:
- Add a **standard benefits checklist** (health insurance, PF, gratuity, leave encashment, WFH allowance, learning budget) — flag missing ones
- Add **industry-standard comparison** (e.g., "most product companies offer 18-24 days PTO, your offer has 12")
- Connect `BenefitBreakdown` totals into the scoring rubric

---

## Stage 3: Contextual AI Analysis

**Current**: AI does everything from scratch with no data.

**Proposed**: AI receives Stage 1 + Stage 2 outputs as context.

The AI prompt now says:
```
SYSTEM INSTRUCTION (separate from user content):
You are an expert compensation analyst. Analyze the following pre-extracted 
and enriched offer data. Do NOT re-extract or invent data — use what's provided.

USER CONTENT:
Here is the extracted offer data (verified from the text):
{extractedData}

Here is the salary benchmark for {role} in {city}:
{salaryComparison — source: crowdsourced/approximate/ai_estimated}

Here are the red flags identified by our rule engine:
{ruleEngineFlags}

Here is the tax-calculated take-home:
{takeHomeBreakdown}

Provide:
1. Executive summary (2-3 sentences)
2. Strengths of this offer
3. Concerns and negotiation leverage points
4. Any additional soft red flags the rules might have missed
5. Industry context for the compensation package
```

**Key design decisions**:
- AI is an *analyst commenting on real data*, not the *data source*
- **Do NOT re-send raw offer text** — only the structured extraction. Saves ~50% tokens
- Use Gemini **system instruction** to isolate analysis instructions from data (prompt injection defense)
- **Token budget**: max ~4K tokens input to Stage 3 (structured data is compact)

### Prompt Versioning

Store prompt template versions in `analysis.aiMetadata` for rollback and A/B testing:

```json
{
  "extractionPromptVersion": "v1.2",
  "analysisPromptVersion": "v1.0",
  "modelUsed": "gemini-2.5-flash",
  "totalTokensUsed": 3847
}
```

---

## Stage 4: Scoring & Validation

### Deterministic Scoring Rubric

**Current**: `score = 70 ± (flags × severity) ± (percentile bump)` — arbitrary.

**Proposed**:

| Component | Weight | Calculation |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **Salary Position** | 35% | `offerPercentile` from real salary data → 0-100 |
| **Red Flag Penalty** | 25% | 100 base, deduct per flag: High −20, Med −10, Low −5 |
| **Benefits Completeness** | 20% | % of standard benefits present from checklist |
| **Growth Signals** | 10% | Equity/ESOP, learning budget, title progression, RSU |
| **Transparency** | 10% | Compensation breakdown clarity, no vague terms |

### Confidence Tagging

| Level | Meaning | UI Treatment |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `high` | Verbatim from offer text | Normal |
| `medium` | AI-inferred from context | 🟡 tag |
| `low` | AI-estimated, no evidence | 🟠 "AI Estimate" badge |
| `unverified` | No ground truth available | 🔴 disclaimer |

## Progressive UX (Frontend)

With 4 stages, processing takes longer. Instead of hiding behind a spinner, **stream partial results** as each stage completes:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant FE as Frontend
    participant W as Worker

    U->>FE: Upload offer
    FE->>W: Process

    W-->>FE: Stage 1 done → extraction
    Note over FE: Show company, role, CTC immediately

    W-->>FE: Stage 2 done → enrichment
    Note over FE: Reveal salary benchmark, red flags, take-home

    W-->>FE: Stage 3 done → AI narrative
    Note over FE: Show executive summary, strengths, concerns

    W-->>FE: Stage 4 done → final score
    Note over FE: Reveal score breakdown with animation
```

**Implementation options** (pick one):
- **Option A**: SSE (Server-Sent Events) for real-time stage updates
- **Option B**: Polling `GET /offers/:id` returns `{ stage: 2, partialResults: {...} }`
- **Option C**: Store stage results in DB progressively, frontend polls and renders as data arrives

Option B is simplest and works with existing polling architecture.

## Decisions Needed

1. **Phase priority**: Start with Phase 0 (evaluation) + Phase 1 (quick wins), or jump to full pipeline?
2. **Tax calculator scope**: Indian-only for now, or plan for multi-country?
3. **Salary data seeding**: Import a public dataset, or start from scratch with crowdsourced data?
4. **Scoring weights**: Are 35/25/20/10/10 (salary/flags/benefits/growth/transparency) reasonable?
5. **Role synonym map**: Manual mapping or use AI to normalize role names?
6. **Progressive UX approach**: SSE, polling with partial results, or simpler approach?
7. **Frontend scope**: How much UI work in this plan, or keep backend-focused?
